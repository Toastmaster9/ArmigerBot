This is a list of parts used for building the ArmigerBot base (STL for the base is included in this repo). While the base is designed to accomidate specific parts from this list, it could easily be modified to fit other stuff. I like adafruit a lot, so I used a lot of their parts. All price estimates are in USD at the time I uploaded this list. Prices will probably go up and availability of parts may change due to the chip shortage.

Battery charger / voltage booster board:
Adafruit Powerboost 1000 Charger ($20) - https://www.adafruit.com/product/2465

Microcontroller:
Adafruit QT PY ESP32-S2 Wifi Dev Board ($12) - https://www.adafruit.com/product/5325

Alternative microcontroller (same pinouts as the one above, but more powerful):
Adafruit QT Py ESP32 Pico ($15) - https://www.adafruit.com/product/5395

Battery (Any 3.7v lipo cell will work as long as it can discharge at at least an amp. Check your battery's data sheet before using it with the battery charger board in this project):
Lithium Ion Polymer Battery, 3.7v/2500mah ($15) - https://www.adafruit.com/product/328

Servos (Adafruit sells these, but you can find them in many other places. SG51R is the one you want):
Sub-micro servo SG51R ($6): https://www.adafruit.com/product/2201

LEDs (This vendor on Amazon sells these in lots of different colors. The LEDs come in with resistors in the bag, but we don't really need them if we run the LEDs on 3v3 from the microcontroller. Nice to have though!)
25x Red micro LEDs ($9): https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07P6L7P6V/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&th=1
25x Green micro LEDs ($9): https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07P5N1DTM/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&th=1

Wire (This is just some cheapo 30AWG silicone insulated wire that I like for its flexibility.)
30 AWG Silicone Wire: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01KQ2JNLI/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1

USB Connectors (these are optional, as you can hardwire all of the different connections in the base. Its up to you)
USB C male connectors 10 pack ($10) - https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09WCQKSW1/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1
USB Micro male connectors 20 pack ($7) - https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07G5ZY7MH/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1
USB Micro female surface mount connectors 10 pack ($6) - https://www.amazon.com/HiLetgo-Adapter-Connector-Converter-pinboard/dp/B07W844N43

Ring bearing for the waist joint (While you can build an armiger bot without these, adding one to the design greatly increases the smoothness of the movement and strength of the model. Important if you are using FDM parts to avoid friction)
R4-2R2 1/4" bore, 5/8" outer diameter ring bearing 10 pack ($10) - https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07GT739PV/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1

Power switch (This part is non specific. Pretty much any switch will work here.)
10 pack of switches ($10) - https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N235HVR/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1

Wifi Antenna (This is optional. Any wifi antenna with a uFL port should work.)
uFL Wifi Antenna ($3) - https://www.adafruit.com/product/2308
